<H2>APIs To Be Used</H2>

    - Musixmatch 

    - Spotify 

<br>

<H2>Rough Breakdown of Tasks</H2>

HTML/CSS team will build out the html page and style it so it has three screen progressions. 

    - screen one: user selects their mood descriptors
    - screen two: user receives song choices from the first API (Musixmatch)
    - screen three: user receives Playlist of songs from second API (Spotify) 

<br>

Javascript team will build out the code to power the HTML.

    - Set up code to parse user selections into appropriate query structure to then be sent to first API (finding song lyrics that match the mood descriptors that the uder chose)
    - Parse data received from first API into a form that is able to be displayed on the browser (selection of songs that match the user mood descriptor criteria)
    - Enable users to make selections of songs displayed on browser from data gathered from first API which will make up their finished paly list
    - take user slections and parse that into a form that can be sent to the second API (Spotify) to create a play list and send that data to the API 
    - Parse the data received from the second API into a format that can be displayed on the browser as the user's new music playlist 

Combined Team
